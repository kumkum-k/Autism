# Autism
Utilizing supervised learning techniques, this project aims to enhance the early diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by analyzing behavioral attributes and individual traits. By leveraging a neural network created with the Keras API, the goal is to develop a diagnostic tool for ASD, potentially leading to improved treatment strategies and reduced healthcare costs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.
